# Raining_API
Here's a basic README.md template for your "Raining API" project:

This project utilizes the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch weather forecast data and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to send an SMS alert if it's predicted to rain.

## Features

- Fetches weather forecast data using OpenWeatherMap API.
- Sends an SMS alert via Twilio when rain is forecasted.
- Customizable location parameters (latitude, longitude).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Requests Library
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Twilio API
- Environment Variables for API keys

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/raining-api.git

2.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Set up your environment variables for OpenWeatherMap API and Twilio:

OWM_API_KEY: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
AUTH_TOKEN: Your Twilio Auth Token.
Alternatively, you can directly add them to the script (not recommended for production).

Usage
1.Modify the coordinates in the parameters section to set your desired location:
parameters = {
    "lat": YOUR_LATITUDE,
    "lon": YOUR_LONGITUDE,
    "appid": api_key,
    "cnt": 4,
}

2.Run the script:
python rain_alert.py

3.If rain is forecasted, you will receive an SMS notification on the specified number.
